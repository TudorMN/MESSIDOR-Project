# MESSIDOR-Project

Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) classification by using Convolutional Neural Networks designed with the Keras library.

The project considers two ways of classification.

Multiclass approach using four classes:
-  0 (DME Free)
-  1 (Mild DME)
-  2 (Moderate DME)
-  3 (Severe DME)

Binary approach:
-  0 (DME Absence)
-  1 (DME Existance)
